# Upload AI ðŸŽ¥âœ¨

Hey there! Glad you stumbled upon my little project. It's a cozy corner of the web where I'm mixing my love for videos with a sprinkle of AI magic. Think of it as your go-to spot for giving your videos not just a voice, but also a brain!

## What's Cooking?

Here's the deal: you've got videos, and sometimes you just want more from them. That's where my app waltzes in. It's a chill place where you can:

- **Upload Your Videos:** Bring 'em in.
- **AI Transcription:** Get your videos transcribed by AI. It's like having a super-smart friend who types really fast.
- **Do Cool Stuff:** Want summaries? Keywords? Mood checks? Just ask, and let the AI do its thing.
- **Play Around:** It's not all serious business. Experiment with what you can ask the AI to do with your transcripts.

## Behind the Scenes

Built with some of my favorite toys:

- **React.js & Tailwind CSS:** For making things pretty and snappy.
- **@ffmpeg/ffmpeg:** Because videos can be tricky.
- **A pinch of AI:** The secret sauce for all the smart stuff.
